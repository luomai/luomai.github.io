      <description>&lt;p&gt;TensorLayer is a popular open-source TensorFlow-based deep learning and reinforcement library. It provides rich neural layers, pre-trained neural networks, data processing, model management and distributed training to facilitate the development of a wide spectrum of deep learning algorithms. TensorLayer has a transparent and flexible programming model, and thus suitable to customise deep neural networks for deployment and research purposes. It exhibits superior performance due to the low-cost integration with the TensorFlow backend. TensorLayer is easy to learn by providing massive tutorials, examples and real-world application codes. Since open-sourced in 2017, it has attracted more than 300,000 downloads, 6000 stars on Github, and 90 contributors around the world. TensorLayer is recently awarded the 2017 best open-source software by the prestigious ACM multimedia community.&lt;/p&gt;
