      <description>&lt;p&gt;TensorLayer is a popular open-source TensorFlow-based deep learning and reinforcement library. It provides rich neural layers, pre-trained neural networks, data processing, model management and distributed training to facilitate the development of a wide spectrum of deep learning algorithms. TensorLayer has a transparent and flexible programming model, and thus suitable to customise deep neural networks for deployment and research purposes. It exhibits superior performance due to the low-cost integration with the TensorFlow backend. TensorLayer is easy to learn by providing massive tutorials, examples and real-world application codes. Since open-sourced in 2017, it has attracted more than 300,000 downloads, 6000 stars on Github, and 90 contributors around the world. TensorLayer is recently awarded the 2017 best open-source software by the prestigious ACM multimedia community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become the foundation of many multimedia applications. To fully achieve its promise, multi-media users are looking for a library that allows them to efficiently design and test DRL agents and integrate the agents into their ap-plications. In this project, we introduce RLzoo, a novel DRL library that makes it easy to design, test and deploy DRL agents. RLzoo has high-level expressive APIs which enable its users to efficiently develop DRL agents. RLzoo users can leverage an automatic agent construction algorithm to seamlessly adopt custom agent modules,e.g., custom neural networks, which is the key for tuning agents for achieving the best possible performance. RLzoo users can access a large number of pre-implemented DRL environments and algorithms, making it a comprehensive DRL platform. On this platform,users can further easily manage and tune DRL agents through an interactive training terminal. Evaluation results show that: com-pared to existing DRL libraries, RLzoo not only achieves a high degree of abstraction in its API design. It also provides numerous useful DRL algorithms and environments which are not available in other libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
